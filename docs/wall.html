<i><b>Proudly serving pie since 1990.</b></i>
<br>
<br>
<p>There are two things that Ron Silver thinks you must  try if you dine-in at Bubby's Tribeca: <a href=https://www.bubbys.com/store/catering/#pies>the pie</a> and <a href=https://www.bubbys.com/store/product/flaky-buttermilk-biscuits/>the biscuits</a>. A clusterfuck of Southern comfort and  electrified American brunch, a meal at the N. Moore restaurant is sure to leave you both satisfied and intrigued by <a href=https://www.ronsilver.studio/> the restauranteur's ecclectic collection of Outsider Art which adorns the interior's brick walls.</a> 

<br><br>Inside the restaurant, a mostly bilingual, deftly skilled, and highly efficient army of bussers, waiters, hosts, managers, pastry chefs, tablerunners, bartenders—even a pizzaiolo—somehow collectively produce hundreds of plates of food in a single brunch service. The energy at a place like Bubby's is uniquely vibrant, marked by the dedicated labor of the community who make its magic possible. 

<br><br>A rite of passage at Bubby's is writing your name on the wall. Finding the names of my childhood friends and coworkers fills me with an inexplicable feeling of belonging and nostalgia: like being euphorically tipsy off of pink lemonade as you wait for the M20 bus to take you and your classmates to school.
