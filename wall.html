<p>There are two things that Ron Silver thinks you have to try if you dine-in at Bubby's Tribeca: <a href=https://www.bubbys.com/store/catering/#pies>the pie</a> and <a href=https://www.bubbys.com/store/product/flaky-buttermilk-biscuits/>the biscuits</a>. A clusterfuck of Southern comfort and  electrified American brunch, a meal at the N. Moore restaurant is sure to leave you satisfied and perhaps somewhat unnerved by <a href=https://www.ronsilver.studio/> the restauranteur's ecclectic collection of Outsider Art which adorns the interior's brick walls.</a></p></a>

<p>Inside the restaurant, a mostly bilungual, deftly skilled and highly efficient army of bussers, pastry chefs, tablerunners, bartenders—even a pizzaiolo—somehow collectively weave together  hundreds of plates of food in a single brunch service. Since the onset of the pandemic, New York's restaurants were hit hard, taking large losses across the industry.</p>

<p>The energy at a place like Bubby's is uniquely vibrant, marked by the dedicated labor of the community who make its magic possible.</p>

<p>A rite of passage at Bubby's is writing your name on the walls. Finding the names of my childhood friends and coworkers fills me with an unexplicable feeling of belonging and nostalgia: like being euphorically tipsy off of a scone with pink lemonade as you wait for the M20 bus to take you and your friends to school.</p> 

<p>I want to create the experience of the community wall in the era of Coronavirus, when folks most need community and are least likely to be able to even enjoy the sight of the name-scrawlen walls if they have any concerns about entering a restaurant due to fears about the air-borne disease.</p> 

<p>By integrating this page with a dynamic sketch book layer, the restaurant's quotidian audience of locals will be able to dawn on the ready cast of employees, and even be able to interactively represent their visit on a community builboard of guests.</p>
